# 🏗️ Block Chain 

**First attempt at building a blockchain mechanism in Java**  

🚀 This project implements a **basic blockchain** system using Java, demonstrating how blocks are linked, mined, and verified for integrity.  

---

## 📖 Features
- 🏗 **Block Creation** – Each block contains a hash, previous hash, timestamp, and data.  
- ⛏ **Proof of Work (Mining)** – Blocks require computational work to be added to the chain.  
- 🔗 **Chain Validation** – Ensures integrity by checking hashes and previous block references.  
- 📜 **JSON Serialization** – Uses Gson to pretty-print the blockchain.
